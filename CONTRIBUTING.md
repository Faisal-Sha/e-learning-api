# Contributing to E-Learning API

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the E-Learning API as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Follow the existing NestJS coding style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, make sure all tests pass:

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run e2e tests
npm run test:e2e

# Check test coverage
npm run test:cov
```

## Documentation

- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
- Update the API documentation if endpoints are modified
- Add comments to your code where necessary

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the package.json version if applicable
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of two other developers

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker]

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## License
