# E-Learning API Platform Demo Script
(Duration: 4 minutes)

## Introduction (30 seconds)
Hello everyone! Today I'm excited to showcase our E-Learning API platform, a robust microservices-based solution designed for scalability, security, and performance. Let me walk you through the architecture and key features that make this system powerful and efficient.

## Architecture Overview (45 seconds)
1. **Microservices Architecture**
   - We've implemented three core services:
     - API Gateway (Port 3002)
     - Course Service (Port 3000)
     - Auth Service (Port 3001)
   - Why? This separation allows independent scaling and maintenance

2. **Communication Pattern**
   - External: HTTP for client communication
   - Internal: TCP for inter-service communication
   - Why TCP internally?
     - Lower latency with persistent connections
     - Reduced protocol overhead
     - More efficient resource usage

## Security Features (45 seconds)
1. **Advanced Authentication**
   - JWT-based authentication with dual-token system
     - Access tokens (15 minutes)
     - Refresh tokens (7 days)
   - Why? Better security with shorter access token life

2. **Security Measures**
   - Rate limiting (5 requests/minute)
   - Environment-based JWT secrets
   - Strong password validation
   - Why? Protection against brute force and common security threats

## Core Features (60 seconds)
1. **User Management**
   - Role-based access (User, Admin, Instructor)
   - Profile management
   - Secure logout with token invalidation
   - Why? Granular access control and security

2. **Course Management**
   - Efficient data transfer using binary serialization
   - Typed message patterns with enums
   - Interface-based type safety
   - Why? Optimized performance and type safety

## Technical Implementation (45 seconds)
1. **API Gateway Features**
   - Smart request forwarding
   - @Client() decorator for service communication
   - Clean controller separation
   - Why? Maintainable and organized code structure

2. **Database Integration**
   - PostgreSQL with TypeORM
   - Proper error handling
   - Audit trail support
   - Why? Reliable data persistence and tracking

## Conclusion (15 seconds)
This architecture provides a solid foundation for scaling our e-learning platform while maintaining security and performance. Thank you for your attention! Any questions?
